<h3> Sloovi assessment by Bright Jonathan </h3>
<hr />

This website application was built in ReactJs, Bootstrap and plain css.

<h4> Step by step guide on how to run the application </h4>
<ul>
   <li>Node must be installed on your computer. You can download Node at nodejs.org. Create React App requires a Node version of at least 10.</li>
   <li>A package manager called npm. It is automatically included in your installation of Node. You need to have an npm version of at least 5.2.</li>
   <li>A good code editor to work with this project files. I highly recommend using the editor Visual Studio Code. You can grab it at code.visualstudio.com.</li>
   <li>create a folder and CD into the directory with your command line and type <i>npx create-react-app my-react-app</i></li>
   <li>Review the project structure.</li>
   <li> To start your React project, you can simply run: <i>npm start</i> or <i>yarn start</i> </li>
